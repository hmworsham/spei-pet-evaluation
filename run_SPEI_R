# After using permutation_experiments.py, and then use prepare_monthly_ETmax.py to get the monthly AED time series

# Then use R package to get SPEI

# Install R 3.6 under anaconda as the system R is upgraded to 4.0 and has a problem in installing ggplot2 and SPEI
# Path
/server/user/anaconda3/bin/R

# FIXME Cannot set up the anaconda with Rstudio

# Use Rstudio to modify the code, open the recent SPEIbase project
serverdata: /home/user/Programs/rstudio

# Then, without using Rstudio for code editing, need to navigate to the script folder
cd /server/user/Script/SPEIbase/R/

# To run anaconda R
/server/user/anaconda3/bin/R

# Add the SPEI to the anaconda packages, in R prompt, add the path
